<p class="p0"><b>CoreCode Privacy Policy 1.2</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1">CoreCode believes strongly in privacy rights and therefore does <b>not collect any data</b> from its customers apart from whats transmitted to us through purchases or by e-mail requests.</p>
<p class="p1">Specifically, our services (apps, websites, etc) do <b>not transmit any data</b> from our customers to us <b>we do not track or collect any kind of information</b> of or about our customers in any way.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Data Received from Apps</b><br></p>

<p class="p1">The <i>only</i> cases where our apps installed on your computer may contact our servers are:</p>
<p class="p1">• apps distributed outside the (Mac) App Store may have a built-in <i>update mechanism</i> (Sparkle) that downloads a XML file from our servers to check whether newer versions are available. <i>No personal data is transmitted</i> from the app to our server in this case.</p>
<p class="p1">• some apps may download and display HTML, TEXT or MOVIE files from our server. <i>No personal data is transmitted</i> from the app to our server in this case.</p>
<p class="p1">• some apps may have the option to send diagnostics data to improve the app to our server. <i>No personal data is transmitted</i> from the app to our server in this case.</p>
<p class="p1">• some apps may have a option to use our server to send notification e-mails. To send these e-mails they are <i>stored temporarily</i> on our server. The only personal data contained in these e-mails is the recipient's e-mail address. This data is accessed and used only used in case the delivery fails to manually re-send those mails in the interest of the customer.</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Data Received through Purchase or E-Mail Support</b><br></p>

<p class="p1">Since we sell apps on the App Store we do not receive any kind of customer information - Apple does not tell developers who their customers are.<br>
The <i>only</i> cases where we obtain and store personal data from customers are:</p>
<p class="p1">• if a (prospective) customer sends us an e-mail, this e-mail is archived for further reference. E-mails commonly contain personal data like names and e-mail addresses. </p>
<p class="p1">• if a customer purchases one of our apps on alternative platforms like Paddle or eSellerate, the entered customer data is collected and made available to us.</p>
<p class="p1">Note that this data is never shared with any other company and if want us to remove your personal data from our records or e-mail archives just inform our <a href="mailto:privacy@corecode.io">data protection official</a>. </p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Newsletter</b><br></p>

<p class="p1">We reserve the right to send newsletter e-mails to all existing customers. You can opt-out of this at any time by contacting our <a href="mailto:privacy@corecode.io">data protection official</a> or by clicking the 'unsubscribe' button in the newsletter.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p2"><b>More</b><br></p>
