<p class="header">Q: Whats the difference between TableEdit and TableEdit-Lite?</p>
<p class="header">A:</p>
<p>TableEdit-Lite is the free version of the spreadsheet TableEdit. In contrast to TableEdit it does NOT have:<br>
• cell content styling including fonts, font styles and sizes, font colors and text alignment<br>
• cell background styling including fill-colors and borders<br>
• cell formatting as currencies, date and time formats and different numbers formats like scientific or percentages<br>
• support for charts &amp; graphs (bar chart, line chart, etc)<br>
• support for a world-class Excel-compatible formula &amp; function system to calculate SUMs and much more (only rudimentary non-updating SUM, PRODUCT, MIN and MAX)<br>
• support for alternating row colors<br>
• support for floating header rows<br>
• support for adjustable row height<br>
• support for table scaling &amp; magnification<br><br>
What does TableEdit-Lite have in common with TableEdit:<br>
• An easy fast, intuitive &amp; Mac-like spreadsheet system<br>
• Support for 16 million rows or columns<br>
• Support for sorting: single columns, parts of columns or the whole table<br>
• Easy column reordering via drag &amp; drop, row-reordering via menu-item<br>
• Easy adding of rows &amp; columns with the draggable plus-buttons<br>
• Excel (.xls, .xlsx) import  &amp; export<br>
• Configurable CSV/TSV import  &amp; export<br>
• PDF export<br>
• Printing support<br>
• Support for Undo and Redo<br>
• Support for going back to any previous saved version of any spreadsheet<br>
• Inserting of rows &amp; columns at arbritrary positions<br>
• Support for drag &amp; drop and copy &amp; paste even from other spreadsheets<br>
• Support for "filling" cells from neighbouring cells<br>
• Support for inserting dates and times into cells<br>
• Support for inserting configurable numbers into cells (ascending, descending, etc)<br>
• Support for autosizing of column widths<br>
• A common file-format with TableEdit, so you can edit TableEdit spreadsheets in TableEdit-Lite and vice versa<br>

<a id="SUM"></a>
<p class="header">Q: Can I calculate any kind of SUM or formula with TableEdit-Lite?</p>
<p class="header">A:</p>
<p>TableEdit does have a world-class Excel-compatible formula system with support for over 100 functions. However, TableEdit-Lite does not have support for that. It only has support for 4 basic functions (SUM, PRODUCT, MIN and MAX) and those functions are calculated and inserted into the destination cell once and not updated when their source cells are updatde. You can insert these functions from the 'Cell' menu. Remember to select the 'source' cells first, and then select the menu-item to insert the function result below, above, right or left of the selected cells.<br>

<a id="WHYCHARGE"></a>
<p class="header">Q: Why was TableEdit changed from free to commercial?</p>
<p class="header">A:</p>
<p>We've worked on TableEdit for more than 4 years, but the total amount of upgrades to the 'Pro' version covered less than 0.2% of our accumulated development costs. Since TableEdit did not generate any income, it was impossible to sustain doing free support and development to add commonly-requested features. There were basically two options, either abandan the project completely, or change to a commercial model where TableEdit costs money instead of being available for free. We felt that our users are better served by a product that costs money but is actively developed than by an abandoned project. We understand that some users will be unable or unwilling to buy TableEdit and so we are doing the following to help those users:<br>
• The last largely free version of TableEdit (1.3.0) will remain available for download and free (but unsupported) use on the <a href="https://www.corecode.io/tableedit_lite/">TableEdit-Lite homepage</a><br>
• We are creating a new product <a href="https://www.corecode.io/tableedit_lite/">'TableEdit-Lite'</a> that is completely free. It contains less features than TableEdit did previously, but will be actively supported going forward<br>
• We are open-sourcing 'TableEdit Lite' completely as a gift to the Mac community so that more features can be added independently of us<br>
