# WindowMover
*v1.0a1*

## Introduction:
WindowMover is application that moves the frontmost window to the mouse cursor position when a hotkey is pressed.

## WARNING:
This application is in early development state and therefore features are missing and problems do exist.
This application is completely unsupported - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## Requirements:
Mac OS X 10.5 or later

## License &amp; Cost:
WindowMover is completely free of charge and licensed under the [Open Source "MIT License"][1].

## Usage:
1.) Place the WindowMover folder anywhere on your hard disk (the "/Applications" folder is most suitable).
2.) Double click WindowMover.
3.) On first start WindowMover will present an dialog asking you for a hotkey to invoke its function.
4.) Press the hotkey you have defined and the frontmost window will move to the current mouse cursor position.

The main use for WindowMover is when you have multiple screens connected to your Mac, some of which may be not viewable (e.g. turned off TV). Moving windows placed on the invisible screen to some other screen is hard in this case (without WindowMover).

Note that WindowMover only shows its "user interface" on first launch to be able to configure the hotkey - to show the dialog on subsequent launches you must hold down alt.

## Known Problems / Todo List:
• Since WindowMover displays an user interface only on first start it may seem like it didn't start at all
