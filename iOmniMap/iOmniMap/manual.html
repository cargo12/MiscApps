<p class="p1">iOmniMap allows you to navigate in any map that you can download or photograph (without requiring an internet connection).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Step 1 - Create a new OmniMap:</p>
<p class="p1">Select the "Create" tab at the bottom left.</p>
<p class="p1">To create a new OmniMap you have to import a picture of the map you want to navigate in, with 3 possible choices:</p>
<p class="p1">• to create a new map by photographing it, touch the "Take a new photograph" button. Note that when photographing maps you should take care hold your iPhone perfectly parallel to the map and make sure north is exactly at the top of the picture. Distortions created by photographing from an angle severely impact the navigation accuracy.</p>
<p class="p1">• to create a map from a picture you have photographed previously, touch the "Choose existing picture" button and select the picture of the map from your photo library.</p>
<p class="p1">• to import a map from the internet, touch the "Download picture from URL" button and enter (or paste) the URL.</p>
<p class="p1">You can see a small preview of the picture to be used in the "source picture preview" area. Once you are satisfied, touch the "Save &amp; Edit" button.</p>
<p class="p1">Note that some "maps" are no "real" maps in a geographical sense at all and therefore can NOT be used with iOmniMap, e.g. the orientational maps often provided by skiing resorts.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Step 2 - Define your OmniMap:</p>
<p class="p1">To be able to use the picture you've imported as a navigate-able "OmniMap" you have to "define" it, so iOmniMap knows where the map is located geographically and how it is scaled (and possibly, oriented). To define a map, you have to "match" two locations displayed on the imported map to the two very same locations as displayed on a world-map. Note that to define a map you have to have an active internet connection, while navigating inside the map also works offline.</p>
<p class="p1">After clicking the "Save &amp; Edit" button you are automatically taken to the screen where you can define the map. Start by touching the "Match first location" button.</p>
<p class="p1">You are now taken to a "split screen", you see the world-map at the top, and your imported map at the bottom. To match the location you have to select the exact same location once as displayed at the top in the world-map (where you have to zoom in to see the same location that is displayed on your imported map), and once in your map at the bottom. E.g. click at one-and-the-same road-fork/building/sight/etc once in the world-map and once in your imported map, while taking care to hit the spot as exact as possible. Preferably pick a distinctive location (so it easy to recognize in both maps) from one of the corners of your map (to increase accuracy). Note that you can perform a long touch on the world-map to switch from "map" to "satellite" view and back. Once you have selected the same location from both maps as accurately as possible, touch the "Save" button in the top-right corner. Now match a second location by touching the "Match second location" button, preferably choosing a location far-away (opposite corner!) from the first location. Touch "Save" again to store the second match.</p>
<p class="p1">If your map is perfectly north-south aligned, i.e. north is exactly at the top of the picture, then you are done already. If the map is not north-south aligned, you have to touch the "3rd" button in the top-right corner and match a third location between the two maps.</p>
<p class="p1">Touch the "Verify result" button to see the result, i.e. the OmniMap as placed inside the world-map. Drag the "opacity" slider to change the translucency of the OmniMap to see whether the OmniMap is placed exactly at the right location, scale and orientation on the world-map. If you are satisfied with the results, go back and touch "Save &amp; Use", else redefine one or more of your matched locations with better accuracy until it is perfect. If your map is completely off-location, remember that you have to match the locations EXACTLY (which requires you to zoom a lot into the world-map) and not just touch roughly the same area.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Step 3 - Navigate inside your OmniMaps:</p>
<p class="p1">Once you have fully defined at least one OmniMap, you can use them to navigate inside them, i.e. to see your current GPS position and heading right within your custom map. Touching "Save &amp; Use" after defining a map takes you to the map screen, but you also always click the "Navigate" tab on the bottom to get there. This map always uses all defined OmniMaps as overlays to a standard map view, so if you are inside or near one of the areas of the OmniMaps you will see them and your location inside them (as denoted with the standard blue pin). Clicking on the bottom right corner allows you to adjust settings like the opacity of the OmniMap overlays, whether the map rotates with your heading and the mode of the standard map. Note that while the OmniMaps are always visible, displaying the portions of the world that are not covered by OmniMaps you've imported, requires an active internet connection.</p>
