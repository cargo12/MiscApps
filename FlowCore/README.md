# FlowCore 
*v1.0b1*

## Introduction:
FlowCore is an application for realtime visualization of flow data.

## WARNING:
This application is completely unsupported - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## Requirements:
Mac OS X 10.5 or later
Intel processor
OpenGL 2.0 compliant video card from NVIDIA
NOTE:	ATI videocards have a problem with FlowCore as of Mac OS X 10.5.6
Maybe future system updates resolve driver problems and thus fix FlowCore

## License &amp; Cost:
FlowCore is completely free of charge.

## Usage:
1.) Place the FlowCore folder anywhere on your hard disk (the "/Applications" folder is most suitable).
2.) Double click FlowCore.
3.) Choose the desiered options and settings in the "Settings" Panel
4.) You can visualize the built in flow data set or choose arbitrary data sets conforming to the [the flow data format of the University Groningen][1].

## Disclaimer:
Since this application contains a foreign data file used with permission here comes a disclaimer:

## **********************************************************************

## Slice of Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of a flow around a block 
## Use under the condition that the people who generated the data
## are properly mentioned:

## The data is generated by R.W.C.P. Verstappen &amp;
## A.E.P. Veldman of the university of Groningen (the Netherlands)
## The technique used to generate the data is described in:
