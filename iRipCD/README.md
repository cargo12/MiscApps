*v1.0a1*

## Introduction:
iRipCD is an application for converting Audio-CDs to high-quality MP3 audio files. iRipCD can "rip" either directly from CD or from WAFF-files to MP3s using the excellent [LAME encoding engine][1].

## WARNING:
This application is in early development state and therefore features are missing and problems do exist.
This application is completely unsupported - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## Requirements:
Mac OS X 10.4 or later

## License &amp; Cost:
iRipCD is completely free of charge and licensed under the [Open Source "MIT License"][2].

## Usage:
1.) Place the iRipCD folder anywhere on your hard disk (the "/Applications" folder is most suitable).
2.) Double click iRipCD.
3.) Choose either Audio-CD or WAV-Files as source.
4.) If you've chose to convert files you have to select them or the surrounding folder by clicking "Select Files..." or by dragging them onto the Text Field or the Application icon.
5.) Choose a quality preset (the default should be fine).
6.) Click "Convert" and choose a destination for the MP3 files (only first time per session).

## Known Problems / Todo List:
• iRipCD doesn't support tagging the encoded files or fetching CD information from the internet
• iRipCD doesn't support (m)any preferences, e.g. one can't choose a permanent destination directory
• iRipCD just chooses the first removeable drive with AIFF files on the root folder as Audio-CD
