# MenuSwitch
*v1.0a2*

## Introduction:
MenuSwitch is an application for switching between running applications - like a "Dock" in your menubar, but without reordering or documents/folders.

## WARNING:
This application is in early development state and therefore features are missing and problems do exist.
This application is completely unsupported - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## Requirements:
Mac OS X 10.4 or later 

## License &amp; Cost:
MenuSwitch is completely free of charge and licensed under the [Open Source "MIT License"][1].

## Usage:
1.) Place the MenuSwitch folder anywhere on your hard disk (the "/Applications" folder is most suitable).
2.) Double click MenuSwitch.
3.) You can click on application icons in MenuSwitch to switch to this application. alt-click, command-click, right-click and drag&amp;drop works as expected.

## Known Problems / Todo List:
• MenuSwitch can't be quit without restarting or resorting to Terminal.app/ActivityMonitor.app/Apple Events/etc
• MenuSwitch doesn't display the application names so apps with the stock icon can't be distinguished
• MenuSwitch doesn't allow documents/folders, like the Dock
• MenuSwitch doesn't allow the application icons to be reordered, like the dock
• MenuSwitch only shows the application icon as stored on disk, not the dynamic version like the dock
• MenuSwitch only shows an standard contextual menu, not the customized version like the Dock
