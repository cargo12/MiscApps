*v1.0a1*

## Introduction:
QTPresenter is application that tells "QuickTime Player" to present a movie on the second monitor while it displays playback progress on the first monitor.

## WARNING:
This application is in early development state and therefore features are missing and problems do exist.
This application is completely unsupported - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## Requirements:
Mac OS X 10.5 or later

## License &amp; Cost:
QTPresenter is completely free of charge and licensed under the [Open Source "MIT License"][1].

## Usage:
1.) Place the QTPresenter folder anywhere on your hard disk (the "/Applications" folder is most suitable).
2.) When you want to view a movie open it using QTPresenter instead of "QuickTime Player". QTPresenter will tell "QuickTime Player" to present a movie on the second monitor and display playback progress on the first monitor.
3.) You can also start QTPresenter after "QuickTime Player" is already playing a movie. In this case QTPresenter will still display the progress of the movie.

The main use for QTPresenter is when you have a TV connected to your Mac as a second display and want to view movies on the TV.Â
