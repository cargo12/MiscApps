# CHMExtractor
*v1.0a1*

## Introduction:
CHMExtractor is an application for converting/extracting Compiled HTML Help (.chm) files so you can view them in any browser.

## WARNING:
This application is in early development state and therefore features are missing and problems do exist.
This application is completely unsupported - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## Requirements:
Mac OS X 10.2 or later (PowerPC only)

## License &amp; Cost:
CHMExtractor is completely free of charge and licensed under the [Open Source "MIT License"][1].

## Usage:
1.) Place the CHMExtractor folder anywhere on your hard disk (the "/Applications" folder is most suitable).
2.) Double click CHMExtractor.
3.) Drag &amp; drop an CHM file onto the Extractor window and wait until the extraction &amp; conversion process finishes.
4.) Repeat for other CHM files or navigate to the extracted CHM-folder with the Finder.

## Known Problems / Todo List:
• CHMExtractor only converts the Table of Contents file (.hhc) into somewhat proper HTML, other important files aren't converted
• CHMExtractor uses the "chmdump" command-line tool and inherits its problems and limitations (thanks for "chmdump"!)
• The User Interface is not finished in any way e.g. the menu-items and the cancel-button don't work
